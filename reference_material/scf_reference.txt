SCF (Secure Controls Framework) – Reference Guide
================================================

Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document is a quick, plain‑language reference for the Secure Controls Framework (SCF) workbook, focused on:

- Terms and column meanings
- How the different sheets relate to each other
- How threats, risks, controls, baselines, maturity, and assessments fit together
- A mental model for using SCF to design and assess a security and privacy program

It assumes you have the official SCF spreadsheet (e.g., “secure-controls-framework-scf-2025-3-1.xlsx”) open while you read.


1. Core idea of the SCF
-----------------------
At its heart, the SCF is:

- A unified **control catalog** for cybersecurity and data privacy
- A **mapping layer** that connects each SCF control to many external standards and regulations
- A **program design toolkit** that helps you:
  - Build baselines (Fundamentals, ESP, AI, etc.)
  - Tag your own “minimum requirements”
  - Evaluate maturity
  - Link threats, risks, controls, assessment objectives, and evidence

Each **row** in the main controls sheet represents **one control** that can be viewed through many lenses (framework mapping, risk/threat coverage, baselines, maturity, SCRM focus, etc.).


2. High-level structure: key sheets
-----------------------------------
The main sheets and how they relate:

1. **SCF Domains & Principles**
   - Defines the top-level **domains** (e.g., GOV, AST, APP) and the associated **cybersecurity and data privacy by design principles**.
   - This is the conceptual “top of the hierarchy.”

2. **SCF 2025.3.1** (Controls Catalog)
   - The primary sheet with **all SCF controls**.
   - Each row is a control with:
     - SCF ID (`SCF #`), domain, title, control statement, guidance, mappings, etc.
     - Columns that describe baselines, threats, risks, minimum requirements, maturity, SCRM focus, and more.

3. **Authoritative Sources**
   - Defines the external frameworks and regulations (NIST, ISO, SOC 2, PCI, etc.).
   - These are referenced as columns in the Controls sheet, where each control row shows which external clauses it supports.

4. **Threat Catalog**
   - Lists **threats** (e.g., natural, human, technical).
   - Includes threat IDs and descriptions.

5. **Risk Catalog**
   - Lists **risks** with IDs and descriptions (what can go wrong and the possible impact).
   - Aligns risks with NIST CSF functions, etc.

6. **Data Privacy Mgmt Principles**
   - Lists privacy management principles.
   - For each principle, references the **SCF controls** that help satisfy it.

7. **Assessment Objectives 2025.3.1**
   - Defines **Assessment Objectives (AOs)** for each control:
     - What to test
     - How to test it (interview, examine, test)
     - What “pass” looks like

8. **Evidence Request List 2025.3.1**
   - Lists types of **evidence artifacts** (e.g., policies, logs, tickets).
   - Maps each evidence item to **the SCF controls it supports**.

In short:
- Domains/Principles → conceptual structure
- Controls sheet → concrete requirements
- Authoritative Sources → external standards
- Threat/Risk catalogs → “why the control exists”
- AOs and Evidence List → “how to test the control”


3. Anatomy of a single control (row)
------------------------------------
In `SCF 2025.3.1`, each control row typically contains:

- **SCF #** (e.g., GOV-01, APP-03.2)
- **Domain** (GOV, AST, APP, etc.)
- **Control name/title**
- **Control statement**: what the organization “shall” do
- **Control objective / rationale**
- **Implementation guidance** (if provided)
- **Testing / audit hints** (if provided)
- **Mappings to other frameworks** (NIST, ISO, SOC 2, PCI, etc.)
- **Risk / Threat mapping columns**
- **Baseline and classification columns** (SCF CORE, MCR/DSR, maturity, SCRM tiers)

You can think of each row as the **central hub** that links out to:
- External standards (via mapping columns)
- Risks and threats (via risk/threat columns)
- Program design decisions (via baselines and minimum requirement markers)
- Assurance/assessment (via AOs and evidence items that reference this control)


4. SCF CORE baselines – what those columns mean
-----------------------------------------------
In the Controls sheet, you will see columns like:

- SCF CORE – Community Derived
- SCF CORE – Fundamentals
- SCF CORE – Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures (MA&D)
- SCF CORE – ESP Level 1 – Foundational
- SCF CORE – ESP Level 2 – Critical Infrastructure
- SCF CORE – ESP Level 3 – Advanced Threats
- SCF CORE – AI-Enabled Operations
- SCF CORE – AI Model Deployment

For each of these columns:

- **Non-blank cell** (often containing the SCF # again) means:
  > “This control is part of this recommended baseline.”

- **Blank cell** means:
  > “This control is not included in this baseline.”

How to use these:

- Filter on a SCF CORE column to show the **entire baseline** for:
  - Small org / safe harbor → Fundamentals
  - External Service Providers (MSP/MSSP, etc.) → ESP Levels 1–3
  - M&A activities → MA&D
  - AI-heavy environments → AI-Enabled Operations / AI Model Deployment

These baselines are **starting points** for designing your control set. You can then tune them for your organization.


5. MCR, DSR, and Minimum Security Requirements
----------------------------------------------
Near the right side of the Controls sheet you’ll see columns like:

- Minimum Security Requirements – MCR + DSR
- Identify – Minimum Compliance Requirements (MCR)
- Identify – Discretionary Security Requirements (DSR)

These are **meant to be filled by you** (or your GRC platform). They are not fully populated by default.

Definitions:

1. **MCR – Minimum Compliance Requirements**
   - Controls that are **required** to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.
   - Example: controls you must implement to satisfy PCI DSS, HIPAA, a defense contract, or a security addendum.

2. **DSR – Discretionary Security Requirements**
   - Controls that are **not strictly required** by an external authority, but you choose to implement them based on:
     - Your risk appetite
     - Best practices
     - Management directives
     - Results of risk assessments or penetration tests

3. **Minimum Security Requirements – MCR + DSR**
   - Conceptually, this is the **union** of MCR and DSR:
     > “All controls that we, as an organization, treat as part of our minimum baseline.”

Practical approach:
- For each in-scope control:
  - Mark **MCR** if external obligations make it mandatory.
  - Mark **DSR** if you adopt it voluntarily for risk management.
- Use **MCR + DSR** as the main filter to answer:
  - “What does *our* minimum security control set look like?”


6. C|P-CMM maturity levels
--------------------------
Also in the Controls sheet are columns labeled:

- C|P-CMM 0 – Not Performed
- C|P-CMM 1 – Performed Informally
- C|P-CMM 2 – Planned & Tracked
- C|P-CMM 3 – Well Defined
- C|P-CMM 4 – Quantitatively Controlled
- C|P-CMM 5 – Continuously Improving

These represent a **capability and maturity model** for each control:

- **Level 0 – Not Performed**
  - The control is essentially not implemented or not recognizable in practice.

- **Level 1 – Performed Informally**
  - Activities happen in an **ad hoc** way; success depends on individual effort, not defined processes.

- **Level 2 – Planned & Tracked**
  - There is a **planned process**; execution is tracked but may vary across teams or people.

- **Level 3 – Well Defined**
  - The process is **documented, standardized, and consistently applied** across the organization.

- **Level 4 – Quantitatively Controlled**
  - The control’s performance is **measured** using metrics; the organization manages it with data.

- **Level 5 – Continuously Improving**
  - The organization regularly uses data and feedback to **refine and improve** the control.

How to use:
- During an assessment, you assign the maturity level per control.
- You can then roll up results by:
  - Domain
  - Business unit
  - Framework mapping
  - Risk category

This turns your control catalog into a **maturity heat map**.


7. SCRM Focus – Supply Chain Risk Management tiers
--------------------------------------------------
In the Controls sheet, the SCRM Focus columns are:

- SCRM Focus – TIER 1 – STRATEGIC
- SCRM Focus – TIER 2 – OPERATIONAL
- SCRM Focus – TIER 3 – TACTICAL

These columns indicate **how each control relates to supply chain risk management**:

- **Tier 1 – Strategic**
  - Controls with a **strategic/long-term** impact on supply chain risk.
  - Example: overall third-party governance, policies, sourcing strategies.

- **Tier 2 – Operational**
  - Controls that affect **day-to-day vendor management**:
    - Onboarding and offboarding suppliers
    - Ongoing monitoring
    - Contract execution and performance management

- **Tier 3 – Tactical**
  - The **hands-on and technical** aspects of SCRM:
    - Specific technical requirements for suppliers
    - Integration controls
    - Detailed configuration and operational checks

Cells typically contain an `x` when a control has that SCRM relevance.

Use-case:
- Filter on Tier 1, 2, or 3 to get:
  - A strategic SCRM control set (Tier 1)
  - An operational vendor risk checklist (Tier 2)
  - A technical SCRM checklist for engineering teams (Tier 3)


8. Threats, risks, and how they connect to controls
---------------------------------------------------
Three main pieces participate in risk/threat linkage:

1. **Threat Catalog**
   - Lists threats (e.g., natural, human, technical) with IDs.
   - Example IDs might be grouped as:
     - NT- (Natural Threat)
     - FT- (Facility Threat)
     - MT- (Malicious Threat)
     - etc. (exact ID scheme depends on the SCF version)

2. **Risk Catalog**
   - Lists risks with IDs and descriptions.
   - Often grouped by topic (access control, business continuity, etc.).
   - Includes attributes like:
     - Risk Category
     - NIST CSF function mapping
     - Impact description

3. **Controls sheet – risk and threat columns**
   - In `SCF 2025.3.1`, there is:
     - A **Risk Threat Summary** column referencing risk IDs.
     - A set of **Risk columns** (e.g., “Risk
R-XX”) where a value indicates that the control mitigates that risk.
     - A set of **Threat columns** (e.g., “Threat
MT-X”) where a value indicates that the control helps counter that threat.

Taken together, these form a chain:

> **Threat → creates or contributes to → Risk → mitigated by → Control**

This is your **traceability**:
- Why does this control exist?
- Which threats/risks does it address?
- How do multiple controls share responsibility for a single risk?


9. Data privacy principles and control mapping
----------------------------------------------
The **Data Privacy Mgmt Principles** sheet provides a privacy-focused lens.

For each privacy principle (e.g., “Data Minimization,” “Purpose Limitation,” etc.), the sheet lists:

- The **principle name**
- A description
- A column that references **SCF control IDs** which support that principle

So you can move through this chain:

> Privacy principle → supporting SCF controls → mapped external frameworks (e.g., GDPR clauses)

This allows you to:
- Design and assess your privacy program using the same control catalog.
- Show how a given SCF control supports both cybersecurity and privacy requirements.


10. Assessment Objectives and Evidence
--------------------------------------
Two sheets support assessment and audit:

1. **Assessment Objectives 2025.3.1**
   - Each row contains:
     - `SCF #` – the control this AO is tied to.
     - `SCF AO #` – the assessment objective ID.
     - An AO description (what to test).
     - Suggested assessment procedures (interview, examine, test).
     - Expected results / success criteria.
   - Sometimes mapped to external assessment frameworks (like NIST 800-53A).

   In other words:
   > Control → Assessment Objective(s) → “How to verify that control is effective”

2. **Evidence Request List 2025.3.1**
   - Each row describes an **evidence item** (policy, report, configuration export, ticket sample, etc.).
   - Includes a column listing **SCF controls** that this evidence supports.

   So:
   > Evidence artifact → supports → one or more controls

Together, they give the **assurance chain**:

> SCF control → Assessment Objective → Evidence Request → Evidence artifact

You use them to plan audits, internal reviews, and external attestations.


11. Authoritative Sources and external framework mappings
---------------------------------------------------------
The **Authoritative Sources** sheet defines:

- Each framework or law (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.).
- How those are labeled and grouped in the workbook.

In the Controls sheet, you’ll see:

- One or more **columns per external framework**.
- For a given control row, those cells contain:
  - The clause reference / requirement ID from the external standard.
  - Sometimes multiple references if the control supports more than one requirement in that framework.

This provides the mapping:

> External requirement → mapped to → SCF control(s)

So you can:
- Start from a framework (e.g., ISO 27001 Annex A).
- See which SCF controls satisfy it.
- Or start from an SCF control and see which external clauses it helps to meet.


12. Putting the flow together – end to end
------------------------------------------
Here is the overall flow, conceptually:

1. **Principles and domains**
   - Domains & Principles + Privacy Principles define **what good looks like at a conceptual level**.

2. **Controls**
   - The SCF Controls sheet turns these into **concrete control statements** with:
     - SCF ID, domain, guidance, mappings, etc.

3. **External requirements**
   - Authoritative Sources + mapping columns connect each control to **external standards and laws**.

4. **Threats and risks**
   - Threat Catalog and Risk Catalog define **what could go wrong**.
   - Risk/Threat columns in the Controls sheet show **which controls mitigate which risks and threats**.

5. **Baselines and internal classification**
   - SCF CORE columns identify **predefined baselines** (Fundamentals, ESP levels, AI, MA&D, etc.).
   - MCR/DSR/MSR columns let **you** define:
     - Compliance-driven controls (MCR)
     - Discretionary controls (DSR)
     - Combined minimum security requirements (MCR + DSR)

6. **Maturity and SCRM lenses**
   - C|P-CMM columns capture **how well** each control is implemented (0–5).
   - SCRM Focus tiers highlight controls by **supply-chain relevance** (strategic/operational/tactical).

7. **Assessment and evidence**
   - Assessment Objectives tell you **how to test** controls.
   - Evidence Request List tells you **what to collect** to prove they are in place and effective.

In text-diagram form:

    Domains & Principles          Data Privacy Principles
              \                           /
               \                         /
                ------> SCF Controls <------
                          /   |                            /    |              Authoritative Sources  Threat & Risk Catalogs
                       \         /
                        \       /
                    Baselines (SCF CORE, MCR/DSR)
                     |       |
                     |   Maturity (C|P-CMM)
                     |   SCRM Focus Tiers
                     |
           Assessment Objectives & Evidence Requests
                     |
                 Evidence Artifacts

Everything begins and ends with the **control row**:
- It is where frameworks, threats, risks, privacy, baselines, maturity, and assessments all converge.


13. Quick glossary
------------------
A few key terms in one place:

- **SCF #**
  - The unique identifier for a control (e.g., GOV-01.2).

- **Domain**
  - High-level grouping such as Governance, Asset Management, Application Security, etc.

- **SCF CORE baseline**
  - A recommended set of controls for a particular use case:
    - Fundamentals, ESP L1–L3, MA&D, AI-Enabled Ops, AI Model Deployment.

- **MCR (Minimum Compliance Requirements)**
  - Controls you must implement to satisfy external obligations (laws, regulations, contracts).

- **DSR (Discretionary Security Requirements)**
  - Controls you choose to implement for risk or best-practice reasons.

- **Minimum Security Requirements (MCR + DSR)**
  - The combination of MCR and DSR – your internal minimum control set.

- **C|P-CMM 0–5**
  - Maturity levels, from Not Performed (0) to Continuously Improving (5).

- **SCRM Focus Tier 1/2/3**
  - Strategic, Operational, and Tactical relevance of a control to supply chain risk management.

- **Threat Catalog**
  - List of potential threats with IDs and descriptions.

- **Risk Catalog**
  - List of risks, often grouped by category and mapped to NIST CSF functions.

- **Assessment Objective (AO)**
  - A testable objective tied to a control:
    - What to test, how to test it, and what a successful outcome looks like.

- **Evidence Request List (ERL) item**
  - A specific evidence artifact (document, log, ticket, report) and the controls it helps support.

- **Authoritative Sources**
  - The external standards and regulations that SCF maps to (NIST, ISO, SOC 2, PCI, etc.).


14. Practical way to use this
-----------------------------
A simple approach to using SCF with this reference:

1. Start in **SCF 2025.3.1** (controls).
2. Choose a **baseline lens** (e.g., Fundamentals, ESP Level 2, AI Model Deployment) using SCF CORE columns.
3. For those controls:
   - Decide which are **MCR** and which are **DSR**.
   - Mark your **Minimum Security Requirements (MCR + DSR)**.
4. For your in-scope controls:
   - Review the **Risk/Threat columns** to understand why each control exists.
   - Note the **framework mappings** to see which external requirements you’re covering.
5. Rate each control’s maturity using **C|P-CMM 0–5**.
6. If supply-chain is a focus, filter by **SCRM Focus tiers**.
7. Use the **Assessment Objectives** and **Evidence Request List** sheets to:
   - Define how you will test each control.
   - Build your evidence collection plan.

This way, you move from abstract requirements and frameworks to a concrete, testable, and explainable security and privacy program, all anchored on the SCF control rows.
