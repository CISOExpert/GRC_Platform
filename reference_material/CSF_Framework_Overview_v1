Below is a self-contained text document you can feed into AI to explain how SCF, ICM, C|P-RMM, and C|P-CMM fit together and how to turn them into a functional application model.

# Integrated Cybersecurity & Privacy Model for Application Design

(SCF + ICM + C|P-RMM + C|P-CMM)

## 1. Purpose

This document describes a unified conceptual model that combines:

* Secure Controls Framework (SCF) controls and catalogs
* Integrated Controls Management (ICM) governance model
* Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Risk Management Model (C|P-RMM) 
* Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Capability Maturity Model (C|P-CMM) 

The goal is to define:

1. Core **entities** (objects/tables).
2. **Relationships** between those entities.
3. **Lifecycle steps** and workflows.

So an application can:

* Maintain a **controls-centric** view of security & privacy. 
* Manage **risk**, **maturity**, and **compliance** in a consistent way. 
* Support **planning, execution, monitoring, and improvement** of GRC operations.

---

## 2. Core Components & Their Roles

### 2.1 Secure Controls Framework (SCF)

SCF is a **common controls catalog** that maps to many laws, regulations, and frameworks. Each SCF control:

* Has a unique identifier and description.
* May be mapped to statutory, regulatory, and contractual **obligations**. 
* Is tagged for **applicability** across People, Processes, Technology, Data, and Facilities (PPTDF). 
* Has associated **Assessment Objectives (AOs)** and **Evidence Request List (ERL)** entries (what you check and what you collect). 

In the application, SCF provides:

* The **master control catalog**.
* A basis for **policies, standards, procedures**, and **assessment criteria**.

---

### 2.2 Integrated Controls Management (ICM)

ICM is a **controls-centric GRC operating model**. It treats controls as the **hub** that everything else anchors to: policies, standards, procedures, metrics, threats, and risks. 

ICM introduces:

1. **Minimum Compliance Requirements (MCR)** – “must-have” controls to satisfy laws, regulations, and contracts.
2. **Discretionary Security Requirements (DSR)** – “above and beyond” controls that reflect risk appetite and desired resilience. 
3. **PPTDF model** for control applicability:

   * People
   * Processes
   * Technology
   * Data
   * Facilities 
4. A **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)** approach to GRC:

   * **Plan** – Establish context, define applicable controls, assign maturity criteria, publish policies & standards.
   * **Do** – Implement controls, assign accountability, operate processes.
   * **Check** – Maintain situational awareness, assess controls, monitor risk.
   * **Act** – Manage risk, evolve processes, remediate deficiencies. 

In the application, ICM defines:

* How to **scope** controls (MCR vs DSR, PPTDF).
* How to **operate** governance, risk, and compliance as connected loops.

---

### 2.3 Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Capability Maturity Model (C|P-CMM)

C|P-CMM is a **maturity model built into SCF**. Each SCF control has defined criteria for maturity Levels L0-L5. 

Defined levels:

* **L0 – Not Performed**
* **L1 – Performed Informally**
* **L2 – Planned & Tracked**
* **L3 – Well Defined**
* **L4 – Quantitatively Controlled**
* **L5 – Continuously Improving** 

Key points:

* Maturity is **nested**: higher levels assume lower levels exist (you cannot “run” before you “walk”). 
* Maturity (governance quality) is **not the same as assurance** (how well the control actually works in practice). 

In the application, C|P-CMM provides:

* Target maturity levels per control, domain, project, or function.
* Actual maturity assessments per control.
* A way to define **negligence thresholds** and “sweet spot” maturity (e.g., L2–L3 is generally expected; L0–L1 may be negligent for certain controls). 

---

### 2.4 Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Risk Management Model (C|P-RMM)

C|P-RMM is a **17-step risk management process** that uses SCF controls, C|P-CMM, and catalogs for risks and threats. 

High-level C|P-RMM steps (summarized):

1. Identify risk management principles.
2. Identify, implement, and document dependencies (risk, technology, business).
3. Formalize risk management practices.
4. Establish a **risk catalog**.
5. Establish a **threat catalog** (natural and manmade).
6. Establish a **controls catalog**.
7. Define **CMM targets** for controls.
8. Define **assessment rigor** levels (1–3).
9. Establish context for assessing risks.
10. Perform **conformity (controls gap) assessment**.
11. Apply **assessment methods** and document findings.
12. Determine **risk exposure** (impact, likelihood, inherent and residual risk).
13. Prioritize and document deficiencies.
14. Report on conformity (Strictly Conforms, Conforms, Significant Deficiency, Material Weakness).
15. Identify appropriate management audience.
16. Management determines risk treatment (reduce, avoid, transfer, accept).
17. Practitioners implement and document treatment. 

In the application, C|P-RMM defines:

* How to turn control gaps into **quantified risks**.
* How to move from **assessment data → risk exposure → treatment decisions**.

## 4. Lifecycle & Workflow Integration

This section describes how to orchestrate the frameworks into a logical, repeatable application workflow.

### 4.1 GRC PDCA Loop (ICM) as the Backbone

1. **PLAN**

   * Import/define **obligations and requirements**.
   * Tailor **SCF controls** into an internal catalog; tag each control as MCR vs DSR and PPTDF.
   * Define **ICM context**: business units, assets, LOB stakeholders, risk appetite.
   * Set **C|P-CMM target maturity levels** per control/domain and define negligence thresholds.

2. **DO**

   * Implement controls via policies, standards, procedures, technologies, and training (mapped to controls).
   * Assign **owners** for controls, risks, and assets.
   * Run projects and BAU operations aligned to controls.

3. **CHECK**

   * Execute **assessments** at defined rigor levels (C|P-RMM Step 8).
   * Collect **evidence** and record **findings** per control and AO.
   * Calculate **C|P-CMM maturity** per control and compare to targets.
   * Use findings to update the **risk catalog** and **risk exposure** (C|P-RMM Steps 4, 12).

4. **ACT**

   * Prioritize deficiencies and update **POA&M** (C|P-RMM Step 13).
   * Produce **conformity reports** (Strictly Conforms, Conforms, Significant Deficiency, Material Weakness). 
   * Route risks to appropriate **management audiences** and record **risk treatment** (Steps 14–16).
   * Implement and track remediation, then re-assess to close the loop (Step 17).

---

### 4.2 C|P-RMM Steps Mapped to App Functions

High-level mapping:

* **Steps 1–3**: Configuration & governance:

  * App modules: “Program Setup”, “Risk Management Settings”, “Roles & Authority Levels”.

* **Steps 4–6**: Catalog management:

  * Risk Catalog → `Risk` entity.
  * Threat Catalog → `Threat` entity.
  * Controls Catalog → `Control` entity (SCF).

* **Step 7**: Maturity targets:

  * `MaturityTarget` entities per control/domain.

* **Step 8–11**: Assessment engine:

  * `Assessment`, `AssessmentObjective`, `EvidenceItem`, `Finding`.

* **Step 12**: Risk exposure calculation:

  * Use `impact_effect`, `occurrence_likelihood`, control weighting, and maturity delta to produce `inherent_risk_score` and `residual_risk_score`. 

* **Steps 13–14**: Prioritization & reporting:

  * Views and reports that aggregate **findings**, residual risk, and conformity status.

* **Steps 15–17**: Governance and execution:

  * Workflow to route decisions to appropriate management based on **risk thresholds**; tracking `RiskTreatment` and `POA&M` tasks until closure.
